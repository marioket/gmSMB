GENERAL INFO

sprites do not scale ingame yet. they should stay proportional to mario 1 mario's size if they need to be any bigger for some reason
your hitbox will always stay the same no matter the sprite size
to export spritesheets properly, just go to file > export > as spritesheet in aseprite


every character by default needs the following sprites
Idle (Big & Small)
Walk (Big & Small)
Jump (Big & Small)
Pivot/Skid (Big & Small)
Die (Small)
Swim (Big & Small)
Climb (Big & Small)
Fireball Throw (Big)
Shrink (Big to small)
Grow (Small to big)
Crouch (Big)
Dance (Optional, Big Or Small)
Palette Sheet

your palette sheet should have every color in the base sprite in a row at the top, this is the "base palette"
copy this row and move it down 1 pixel, this is the "default palette"
copy this row and move it down 1 pixel, then edit the colors for the fire flower palette
from this point onward, any extra rows are custom palettes you can equip in the options menu.
the palette sprite must be 8 pixels in width. i dont know why. it just crashes if you dont.
(This is probably me not actually understanding how the palette system works! Oops!!)

it is recommended that grow and shrink stay at 14 and 17 frames in length respectively for timing ingame

MAIN.INI INFO

the id variable is the name your sprites will be added under internally. make sure this does not conflict with any other mods you have on. it cannot have any spaces in it
for frame counts, just type out a sprite name in the correct area, put an equals after it and then a number to specify frame count

you can declare x and y origins for specific sprites by adding xOrigin and yOrigin respectively after the sprite name


SOUND INFO

right now you can only add 3 sounds to your character. small jump, big jump, and death
these sounds MUST be .ogg files!!!!
these need to be in a folder named "sound" and need to be named the following:

sndJump_ID
sndJumpbig_ID
sndDie_ID

ID should be whatever the id is set to in main.ini
